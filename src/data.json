However, I do NOT see this as a disadvantage. My degree in Multimedia Design is what enabled my interest again in web development as an adult. It has also given me the opportunity to explore graphic design as well as web development and other areas. Because of this, I feel that I bring a unique perspective to most projects. My passion however has always been programming.",
