However, I do NOT see this as a disadvantage. My degree in Multimedia Design is what enabled my interest again in web development as an adult. It has also given me the opportunity to explore graphic design as well as web development and other areas. Because of this, I feel that I bring a unique perspective to most projects. My passion however has always been programming.",

When I heard about this really cool editor from a friend, the editor was named atom and i was interested bacause it was using front end web technologies in under the hood. I also tried brackets but it did not have the same appeal to me as atom. ",

I had tried atom but I wanted something like atom but that also had a bit more of an IDE feel but still a text editor, So I decided to try the one editor i hadnt tried and I Loved it!",
